# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:** Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days
- **Movie Title:** Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days
- **Why I chose this movie:** This is one of my favorite movies I enjoy watching with my family. 

**Core Emotion:**
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:** Joy

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:** The family and a summer setting
- **Why this element:** This movie is centered around family and the movie is based in the summer.

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:**  Sadness

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):**  Yellow, blue, white, green
- **Accent color(s):**  Yelow
- **Overall mood:** Warm

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [x] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description:** Greg should be in the center

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:** Make me a diary of a wimpy kid: dog days movie poster with colors yellow, summer themed, warm vibes, happy, and the family included

- **What worked:** Happy, summer vibes 
- **What didn't work:**  Had the wrong characters and the background for many of the images were completely yellow.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:** I will make a more specific prompt.

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:** Make a poster for the Disney Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Dog Days book by Jeff Kinney with a summer background, warm colors, the family (of the characters), with Greg in the middle.

- **What worked:**  Summer background
- **What didn't work:** Included the wrong characters and it was a very cartoon style.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:** I will make the prompt even more specific by asking to include the real characters (and name the characters) and to make the graphics more realistic.

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a poster for the Disney Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Dog Days book by Jeff Kinney with a summer background, warm colors, the family (of the characters), with Greg in the middle. Include characters, Greg, Rodrick, Rowley, the dog, the Mom, and the Dad. Make graphics more realistic.
- **What worked:**  Included a summer background
- **What didn't work:**  Did not include the family and the setting was in a forest.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  I am going to ask Gemini instead.

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a poster for the Disney Diary of a Wimpy Kid : Dog Days book by Jeff Kinney with a summer background, warm colors, the family (of the characters), with Greg in the middle. Include characters, Greg, Rodrick, Rowley, the dog, the Mom, and the Dad. Make graphics more realistic and the background of a house on a sunny summer day.

- **What worked:**  Very precise, included Greg in middle with family, with the background of a house on a sunny summer day.
- **What didn't work:** There were cartoon graphics and less realistic. 

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)  

--- I chose Attempt 4 as my final image, as it was the most precise and closely matched what I wanted the movie poster to look like.

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  Added a yellow border
2.  Cropped out the top of the sky
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  
My vision evolved through first just wanting the family with a summer background to the family with a house in a summer background with more specific details.

**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  
I am most proud of my desision with the focal point placement, as I had Greg, the main character in the middle surrounded by his family.

**What would you do differently next time?**  
I would make the graphics more realistic and also include Rowley and Holly, Greg's friends as well in the poster.
